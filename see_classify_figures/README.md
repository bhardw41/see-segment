# SEE Classify Figures
### Author: Davin Lin
### Date: 2021-08-06

This directory contains figures that were generated using see-classify
during the MSU ICER ACRES 2021 program. A commit hash can be found at
the beginning of each figure's notebook. For reproducibility, these 
indicate the git commit that was used to generate the corresponding figure.

Also for reproducibility, the environment used to generate 
all of the figures has been written to `req.txt`.

The instructions for generating and extracting data can also
be found at the beginning of the notebooks or in the `data_creation_instructions`
variable located in `figures_markdown_snippets.py`.
